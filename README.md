# Tulsa Auction Analysis 2024

This project analyzes home auction sales in Tulsa County using OCR, data wrangling, and descriptive analytics in Python. The analysis includes extracting data from PDFs, cleaning and structuring it, and then performing exploratory descriptive analytics to uncover trends in home auctions for 2024.

## Project Overview

The analysis focuses on:
- Extracting text and numeric data from auction documents using OCR.
- Cleaning and structuring data for analysis.
- Performing descriptive analytics to gain insights into auction trends, pricing, and property information.

## Project Structure

- **01 Project Management:**  
  Contains planning documents, project milestones, risk assessments, and other management files.

- **02 Data:**  
  Includes source documents such as PDFs and Excel files that provide raw home auction sales data.

- **03 Scripts:**  
  Houses all Python code including scripts and Jupyter notebooks. This code handles OCR processing (using Tesseract-OCR and Poppler), data wrangling with Pandas, and transformations needed to prepare the dataset for analysis.

- **04 Analysis:**  
  Contains descriptive analyses, visualizations, and insights derived from the cleaned data.

- **05 Sent to Client:**  
  Final reports and deliverables prepared for the client.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Python** – The primary programming language used for data processing.
- **Pandas** – For data wrangling, cleaning, and analysis.
- **Poppler** – Utility for handling PDF files.
- **Tesseract-OCR** – Optical Character Recognition (OCR) tool used to convert scanned PDFs to text.
- **GitHub** – For version control and collaborative project management.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
